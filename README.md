## Polar Engine
The Polar engine is my first attempt at building a working game engine with 3D implementation. Initially built by following an online course, I'am planning on expanding features to fit the requirements of a game I have been planning & designing. My aims for this project are to better understand desktop application development using C++, understand graphics programming as well how game engines are designed and created.
